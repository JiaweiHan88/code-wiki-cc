# Code Wiki

Generate — and later maintain — a wiki for a codebase, rendered as a **single self-contained `index.html`** with a 3-level left-sidebar. Scope can be a whole repo or **one component folder inside a large monorepo**. Content is authored as Markdown (also renders on GitHub); a bundled build script assembles the HTML.

Reference documentation (what/how). In deep mode it adds short git-grounded *why* notes, but it is not a product-strategy narrative.

## When to use

"Document this codebase / this component", "generate a wiki", "update the wiki", "make architecture diagrams", onboarding to a repo or a package within a monorepo.

Do **not** use it for: a single file/function or one endpoint (answer inline); a one-off diagram (produce just that diagram, not a wiki); questions during active development (answer as they come); pure "why"/strategy essays.

## Environment and tools

Standard Claude tools: `bash` (list/search/git/run the build script), `view` (with `view_range`), `create_file`/`str_replace`, and `present_files`. In **Claude Code** the working directory is the target repo and the build script is at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_html_wiki.py`. `git` and network may be unavailable — degrade gracefully. Prefer `rg`; the build script is stdlib-only (no pip, no network to build); Mermaid renders from a CDN (`--mermaid-src` for offline).

## Step 1 — Resolve scope (repo root + component)

Git is repo-wide; the wiki targets one folder. See `references/maintenance.md` for the exact commands. In short:

- `REPO_ROOT` = `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; `SCOPE` = the component folder to document (defaults to the cwd; a whole-repo run sets `SCOPE=REPO_ROOT`); `SCOPE_REL` = `SCOPE` relative to `REPO_ROOT` (`.` for whole-repo).
- Document **only** files under `SCOPE`. Cross-component imports are noted as external deps by path, not documented.
- Output goes **inside the component**: `WIKI_DIR = SCOPE/wiki`. Nothing is written at the monorepo root. In the Claude.ai sandbox, use `/mnt/user-data/outputs/<name>-wiki` instead and `present_files` at the end.
- **All git commands run at `REPO_ROOT` but are path-filtered with `-- "$SCOPE_REL"`** — this is how a huge monorepo's history stays relevant to just the folder.

## Step 1.5 — Load the ignore list (`.codewikiignore`)

If `REPO_ROOT/.codewikiignore` exists with active rules, ignored paths must stay **entirely** out of the run — not read, not shelled to, not described. Gitignore syntax: `#` comments, blank lines, `*`/`**`/`?` globs, directory rules (`dir/`), `!` negation. **Nests like real `.gitignore`**: a file inside a subfolder (e.g. a monorepo component) applies only within that subfolder, with patterns relative to *its own* directory, and can override — including re-include via `!` — whatever a parent-directory file said, but only for paths it has an opinion on; where it's silent, the parent's verdict stands. The bundled `scripts/apply_ignore.py` is the single source of truth and handles this layering automatically:

```bash
IGN="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/apply_ignore.py"
if python3 "$IGN" active "$REPO_ROOT"; then
  # the ONLY files you may read/describe under the component (minus the wiki's own output):
  python3 "$IGN" list "$REPO_ROOT" --scope "$SCOPE_REL" | grep -v "^$WIKI_REL/"
fi
```

Rules while an ignore list is active:
- Drive all discovery (`find`/`rg`/`ls`/`view`) from that allowed list. Never `view`/`cat`/`grep`/`git show` a path outside it, even to "verify" — check first with `python3 "$IGN" check "$REPO_ROOT" <path>`.
- **Never describe an ignored path** in any page, and drop ignored paths from git evidence and from the update change-set (see `references/maintenance.md`).
- Hard enforcement for headless/CI: add `python3 "$IGN" deny-rules "$REPO_ROOT" --scope "$SCOPE_REL"` output to the `deny` list in `.claude/settings.json` so the harness blocks reads/exec on those paths regardless. `--scope` includes root-level rules plus any ignore file at or under the component, correctly path-prefixed.
- A component may keep its own `<component>/.codewikiignore` for rules only it needs (e.g. its own `secrets/`) without editing the root file; the root file still applies everywhere as a base layer.

This composes with scope (only under `SCOPE`, minus ignored) and with the secrets rule below (defence in depth).

## Step 2 — Resolve lifecycle × depth

Two independent dials. Ask only if the user gave no signal.

**Lifecycle** (from `references/maintenance.md`): `init` (create), `update` (maintain), or `auto` — if `WIKI_DIR/.codewiki-state.json` exists → update, else init.

**Depth**: signals "quick/light/overview" → light; "deep/thorough/exhaustive" → deep. On update, depth defaults to the recorded value unless overridden.

| Aspect | **Light** | **Deep** |
|---|---|---|
| Modules documented | top 8–10 | all significant (confirm cost if >~20) |
| Per-module depth | purpose, key files, public API, deps, gotchas | + function-by-function walkthrough, edge/error handling, per-module diagram when complex |
| Diagrams | 1 architecture flowchart, 1 class, 2–3 sequences | + per-subsystem flowcharts, 4–8 sequences incl. error paths |
| Git *why* notes | none | short, git-grounded notes on non-obvious design decisions (see Step 3) |
| API reference | only if clearly a library/API server | always when a public surface exists |

## Step 3 — Scoped git evidence

Run the scoped, read-only git commands in `references/maintenance.md` (status/rev-parse/diff/log, all `-- "$SCOPE_REL"`). Keep the assembled output as the change context. In **deep** mode, use `git log --oneline -- <file>` and selective `blame`/`show` on high-signal files to explain *why* important code exists — but do not paste commit-hash lists into the docs unless a specific commit documents a decision.

## Quick reference

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Resolve `REPO_ROOT`, `SCOPE`, `SCOPE_REL`, `WIKI_DIR` |
| 1.5 | Load `.codewikiignore`; if active, restrict discovery to `apply_ignore.py list` and filter git evidence |
| 2 | Resolve lifecycle (init/update/auto) × depth (light/deep) |
| 3 | Collect scoped git evidence |
| 4 | **update**: run the no-op check (`references/maintenance.md`) — stop if nothing changed |
| 5 | Scan the component; pick modules (light 8–10 / deep all significant) |
| 6 | Author/refresh Markdown from `references/templates.md` (update = surgical) |
| 7 | Build HTML: `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-.}/scripts/build_html_wiki.py" "$WIKI_DIR" --title "<component>" --subtitle "<repo ▸ scope>"` |
| 8 | Verify; write `WIKI_DIR/.codewiki-state.json` (content hash); report / `present_files` |

## Procedure

### Scan (init) — step 5
Within `SCOPE` only: `ls`, a depth-3 `find`, read manifests and the component README. Skip vendored/generated code and sibling components. Pick modules by import-count (via `rg`), size, README prominence. State the module list before writing on a big component.

### Author (init) or refresh (update) — step 6
Follow `references/templates.md` for each page. **Read source with `view` before writing about it**; verify every claim and diagram node against real code. Write `README.md`, `architecture.md`, `getting-started.md`, `modules/<name>.md`, `diagrams/class-diagram.md`, `diagrams/sequences.md`, and `api.md` per the depth rules, all under `WIKI_DIR`.

For **update**: run the no-op check first (stop if clean). Otherwise be **surgical** — regenerate only the module pages whose owned source files changed, touch `README`/`architecture` only if the module set or entrypoints changed, preserve accurate prose, and avoid formatting-only churn. Full mechanics in `references/maintenance.md`.

### Build, state, report — steps 7–8
Always rebuild `index.html` from the Markdown (it is derived). Write the state file with the recomputed `content_hash` — on a no-op, do not rewrite it. In the sandbox, `present_files` (lead with `index.html`).

## Secrets and privacy

Never read or document secret values: `.env`, credentials, private keys, tokens. `.env.example`/sample config may be read only if it holds placeholders. If a secret-bearing file is relevant, note only that such configuration exists and where non-sensitive setup belongs — never its contents.

## Subagents for a large component (Claude Code)

When a component is large with several substantial, independent sub-areas, use the Task tool to parallelize **read-only** research: 1–2 subagents by default (3–4 only if the sub-areas are clearly independent). Each gets a narrow brief (e.g. data layer, API surface, integrations) and returns source-grounded findings with paths; the main agent synthesizes and does **all** writes. Subagents never write to `WIKI_DIR`. (No subagents in the single-agent sandbox — proceed directly.)

## Scope control

A full deep wiki for a big component is expensive. Scan to depth 3; skip vendored/generated code (`vendor/`, `third_party/`, `*_pb2.py`, `*.min.js`, lockfiles, build output) and sibling components. For a large component in deep mode, ballpark the cost first and confirm.

## Pitfalls

- **Documenting outside the scope.** Stay under `SCOPE`; sibling monorepo packages are external deps, not content.
- **Unfiltered git in a monorepo.** Always `-- "$SCOPE_REL"`, or the history/diff is dominated by unrelated packages.
- **Skipping the no-op check on update.** Re-running should touch nothing when nothing changed.
- **Non-surgical updates.** Don't rewrite accurate pages or make formatting-only edits.
- **Fabricating components.** Every node/call must exist in source — `view` before writing.
- **Force-fitting a class diagram** onto function-oriented code; document real classes + an import graph instead.
- **Mermaid:** quote labels with slashes/parens (`A["a / b"]`); `<br>` for line breaks; generics render `~T~`; no `%%{init}%%` blocks (the build script escapes `<>&` inside diagrams for you).
- **Reading secrets.** Never open `.env` or credential files.
- **Touching an ignored path.** When `.codewikiignore` is active, never read/shell/describe a path outside `apply_ignore.py list` — `check` it first if unsure.

## Verification

Loop **per file** so failures name the offender:

```bash
# 1. Balanced fences in every Markdown file
for f in "$WIKI_DIR"/*.md "$WIKI_DIR"/diagrams/*.md "$WIKI_DIR"/modules/*.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue; t=$(grep -c '^```' "$f")
  [ $((t % 2)) -eq 0 ] || echo "UNBALANCED FENCES: $f ($t)"
done
# 2. Core files exist
for f in README.md architecture.md getting-started.md .codewiki-state.json; do
  [ -f "$WIKI_DIR/$f" ] || echo "MISSING: $f"; done
# 3. Module count matches step 5
echo "modules: $(ls "$WIKI_DIR/modules" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
# 4. HTML built with expected diagram count
[ -f "$WIKI_DIR/index.html" ] && echo "mermaid in html: $(grep -c '<pre class=\"mermaid\">' "$WIKI_DIR/index.html")"
# 5. State scope is correct and git evidence stayed scoped
grep -o '"scope": *"[^"]*"' "$WIKI_DIR/.codewiki-state.json"
```

Spot-check 2–3 referenced source paths resolve, and confirm no path outside `SCOPE` was documented.

## Bundled resources

- `scripts/build_html_wiki.py` — stdlib-only builder → one self-contained `index.html` with a **3-level sidebar** (group → page → the page's `##` subsections, auto-expanding), `--title`/`--subtitle` (subtitle shows the `repo ▸ component` path), active-link highlighting, a filter box, dark-mode, and Mermaid.
- `scripts/apply_ignore.py` — stdlib matcher for `.codewikiignore` (gitignore syntax). `active` (is it on?), `list` (allowed files under a scope), `check` (is a path ignored?), `deny-rules` (Read/Bash deny entries for `.claude/settings.json`). The single source of truth for what the wiki may touch.
- `references/templates.md` — per-document Markdown templates and depth notes. Read before authoring.
- `references/maintenance.md` — scope resolution, scoped git, the init/update lifecycle, the no-op check, surgical-update mechanics, and the state-file schema. Read before Step 1.
